A proxy is an "intermediary" between a client making an HTTP request, and a server responding to that request.

Generally speaking there are 2 types of proxies:

1. **Forward proxies** sit between the client and "the internet" (also called tunnels or gateways).
2. **Reverse proxies** sit between "the internet" and a server.

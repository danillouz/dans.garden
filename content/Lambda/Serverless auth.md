Auth is complicated. It can be difficult to reason about and can be hard to work with. The terminology can be complex as well, and terms are sometimes used interchangeably or can be ambiguous. Like saying "auth" to refer both to authentication (who are you?) and authorization (I know who you are, but what are you allowed to do?).

On top of that it can also be challenging to know when to use what. Depending on what you're building and for whom, different auth protocols and strategies might be more suitable or required.

This page does not explore these protocols and strategies in depth. Instead, I want to show that implementing something as complex as auth doesn't have to be too difficult. In order to do that I'll focus on a specific (but common) use case, and show a way to implement it.

## Use case and technologies

How can we secure an HTTP API with a token based authentication strategy, so only authenticated and authorized clients can access it?

More specifically:

- The HTTP API is an [AWS API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html) (APIG).
- The API endpoints are protected with a [bearer token](https://oauth.net/2/bearer-tokens) and implemented as [Lambda Proxy Integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html).
- [Auth0](https://auth0.com) is used as a third-party auth provider.
- An [APIG Lambda Authorizer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.html) is used to verify the token with Auth0.
- The Lambdas are implemented using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and the [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com).
- [curl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL) is used as a "client" to send HTTP requests to the API with a token.

## Why use a third-party auth provider?

I'll be using Auth0 as a third-party auth provider. This means that I'm choosing _not_ to build (nor operate!) my own "auth server". So before we get started, I think it's important to explain the motivation behind this decision.

In order to build an auth server you could use:

- [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2): an authorization protocol.
- [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/connect) (OIDC): an authentication protocol. This is an "identity layer" built on top of OAuth 2.0.
- [Token based authentication](https://auth0.com/learn/token-based-authentication-made-easy): a strategy that requires a client to send a signed bearer token when making requests to a protected API. The API will only respond to requests successfully when it receives a verified token.
- [JSON Web Token](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519) (JWT): a way to send auth information (i.e. "claims") as JSON. A JWT contains a `Header`, `Payload` and `Signature` which are Base64 encoded and separated by a period. In effect, a JWT can be used as a bearer token[^1].

[^1]: You can see how a JWT looks like by visiting [jwt.io](https://jwt.io).

And with perhaps the help of some other tools and libraries you might be confident enough to build an auth server yourself. But I think that in most cases you shouldn't go down this route[^2]. Why not? Because it will cost a _lot_ of time, energy and money to build, operate and maintain it.

[^2]: However, building an auth service yourself is a great learning experience. I think it's quite fun and challenging. And more importantly, you'll get a deeper understanding of the subject, which will be _very_ helpful when you're navigating the "documentation jungle" of your favorite auth provider.

If you do have a valid use case, plus enough resources, time and knowledge to build your own auth server, it might make sense for you. But I think that in most cases you should use a third party auth provider instead. Like [AWS Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito) or [Auth0](https://auth0.com).

Third-party auth providers give you all the fancy tooling, scalable infrastructure and resources you will need to provide a secure, reliable, performant and usable solution. Sure, you'll have to pay for it. But I think the pricing is typically fair. And it will most likely be a small fraction of what it would cost when you'd roll your own solution.

Another sometimes overlooked benefit of choosing "buy over build", is that you'll get access to the domain expert's knowledge. Where they can advise and help you choose the best auth strategy for your use case.

And last but not least. By having someone else deal with the complexities and challenges of auth, you can focus on building your product!

Okay, let's get started.

## What will we build?

We'll build an Account API with a single endpoint that returns some profile information for a user.

Requirements and constraints are:

- The endpoint will be `GET /profile`.
- The business logic of the endpoint will be implemented by a Lambda handler:
  - The Lambda will return data as JSON.
  - The Lambda will return a single property `name` with value `Daniël`.
  - The Lambda will return HTTP status code `200`.
- The endpoint will require a bearer token to return the profile data.
  - The token will be sent via the `Authorization` request header.
  - The `Authorization` request header value must have the format: `Bearer <TOKEN>`.
  - The token is verified by a Lambda Authorizer with the help of Auth0.

This API isn't very useful, but gives us something to work with in order to implement auth.

### Example

```sh title="HTTP request"
GET /profile
Authorization: Bearer eyJ...lKw
```

```sh title="HTTP response"
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Daniël"
}
```

## Registering the API with Auth0

When the Account API receives a request with the bearer token, it will have to verify the token with the help of Auth0. In order to do that, we first have to register our API with them:

1. [Sign up](https://auth0.com/signup) and setup your tenant.
2. In the Auth0 dashboard, navigate to "APIs" and click on "Create API".
3. Follow the [instructions](https://auth0.com/docs/apis) and provide a "Name" and "Identifier". For example `Account API` and `https://api.danillouz.dev/account`[^3].
4. Use `RS256` as the signing algorithm (more on that later).
5. Click on "Create".

[^3]: The "Identifier" doesn't have to be a "real" endpoint.

![[_assets/Serverless auth/Auth0/register.png]]

### Lambda Authorizer configuration

Now that our API is registered, we need to take note of the following (public) properties, to later on configure our Lambda Authorizer:

- Token issuer: this is basically your Auth0 tenant. It always has the format `https://TENANT_NAME.REGION.auth0.com`. For example `https://danillouz.eu.auth0.com`.
- JWKS URI: this returns a [JSON Web Key Set](https://auth0.com/docs/jwks) (JWKS). The URI will be used by the Lambda Authorizer to fetch a public key from Auth0 and verify a token (more on that later). It always has the format `https://TENANT_NAME.REGION.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json`. For example `https://danillouz.eu.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json`.
- Audience: this is the "Identifier" you provided during step 3 of [[#Registering the API with Auth0]]. For example `https://api.danillouz.dev/account`.

You can also find these values under the "Quick Start" tab of the API details screen (you were redirected there after registering the API). For example, click on the "Node.js" tab and look for these properties:

- `issuer`
- `jwksUri`
- `audience`

![[_assets/Serverless auth/Auth0/Quick start.png]]

## What's a Lambda Authorizer?

I haven't explained what a Lambda Authorizer is yet. In short, it's a feature of APIG to control access to an API.

<blockquote>
  <p>A Lambda authorizer is useful if you want to implement a custom authorization scheme that uses a bearer token authentication strategy such as OAuth.</p>

  <cite>
    <p><a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-use-lambda-authorizer.html">AWS docs: Use API Gateway Lambda authorizers</a></p>
  </cite>
</blockquote>

There are actually two types of Lambda Authorizers:

1. Token based authorizers.
2. Request parameter based authorizers.

We'll be using the token based authorizer, because that supports bearer tokens.

### What should it do?

When a Lambda Authorizer is configured, and a client makes a request to APIG, AWS will invoke the Lambda Authorizer _first_ (i.e. before the Lambda handler). The Lambda Authorizer must then extract the bearer token from the `Authorization` request header and validate it by:

1. Fetching the JWKS (which contains the public key) from Auth0 using the JWKS URI[^4].
2. Verifying the token signature with the fetched public key.
3. Verifying the token has the correct issuer and audience claims.

[^4]: We get the JWKS URI, issuer and audience values from the [[#Lambda Authorizer configuration]].

Only when the token passes these checks should the Lambda Authorizer return an [IAM Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies.html) document with `"Effect"` set to `"Allow"`:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": "execute-api:Invoke",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "ARN_OF_LAMBDA_HANDLER"
    }
  ]
}
```

It's this policy that tells APIG it's _allowed_ to invoke our downstream Lambda handler. In our case that will be the Lambda handler that returns the profile data.

Alternatively, the Lambda authorizer may _deny_ invoking the downstream handler by setting `"Effect"` to `"Deny"`:

```json showLineNumbers
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": "execute-api:Invoke",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Resource": "ARN_OF_LAMBDA_HANDLER"
    }
  ]
}
```

This will make APIG respond with `403 Forbidden`. To make APIG respond with `401 Unauthorized`, return an `Unauthorized` error from the Lambda Authorizer. We'll see this in action when implementing the Lambda Authorizer.

### A note on authorization

I found it good practice to only _authenticate_ the caller from the Lambda Authorizer and apply _authorization_ logic downstream (i.e. in the Lambda handlers).

This may not be feasible in all use cases, but doing this keeps the Lambda Authorizer _simple_. So I think that ideally the Lambda Authorizer is only responsible for:

- Verifying the token.
- Propagating authorization information downstream.

The downstream Lambda handler can then use the authorization information to decide if it should execute its business logic for the specific caller or not.

Following this design also leads to a nice decoupling between the authentication and authorization logic (i.e. between the Lambda Authorizer and Lambda handlers).

#### Scopes

When using OAuth 2.0, scopes can be used to apply authorization logic. In our case we could have a `get:profile` scope. And a Lambda handler can check if the caller has been authorized to perform the action that is represented by the scope. If the scope is not present, the Lambda handler can return a `403 Forbidden` response back to the caller.

You can configure scope in the Auth0 dashboard by adding permissions to the registered API. Navigate to the "Permissions" tab of the API details screen and add `get:profile` as a scope.

![[_assets/Serverless auth/Auth0/API permissions.png]]

We'll use this scope when implementing the Account API. And you can read more about scopes in the Auth0 [docs](https://auth0.com/docs/scopes/current).

#### Context

You can propagate authorization information (like scopes) downstream by returning a `context` object in the Lambda Authorizer's response:

```js showLineNumbers {16-18}
"use strict"

module.exports.authorizer = (event) => {
  const authResponse = {
    principalId: "UNIQUE_ID",
    policyDocument: {
      Version: "2012-10-17",
      Statement: [
        {
          Action: "execute-api:Invoke",
          Effect: "Allow",
          Resource: event.methodArn,
        },
      ],
    },
    context: {
      scope: "get:profile",
    },
  }

  return authResponse
}
```

But there's a caveat here. You can _not_ set a JSON serializable object or array as a valid value of any key in the `context` object. It can only be a `String`, `Number` or `Boolean`:

```js
context: {
  a: 'value', // ✅ OK
  b: 1, // ✅ OK
  c: true, // ✅ OK
  d: [9, 8, 7], // ❌ Will NOT be serialized
  e: { x: 'value', y: 99, z: false } // ❌ Will NOT be serialized
}
```

Any "valid" properties passed to the `context` object will be made available to downstream Lambda handlers via the `event` object:

```js showLineNumbers
"use strict"

module.exports.handler = (event) => {
  const { authorizer } = event.requestContext
  console.log(authorizer.scope) // "get:profile"
}
```

## Solidifying our mental model

With that covered, we're ready to build the Lambda Authorizer and the Account API. But before we do, let's take a step back and solidify our mental model first.

To summarize, we need the following components to protect our API:

- Auth0 as the third-party auth provider to issue and help verify bearer tokens.
- APIG to represent the Account API.
- A Lambda Authorizer to verify tokens with Auth0.
- A Lambda handler for the `GET /profile` endpoint to return the profile data.
- `curl` as the client to send HTTP requests to the API with a token.

We can visualize how these components will interact with each other like this.

![[_assets/Serverless auth/Auth flow.png]]

1. `curl` will send an HTTP request to the `GET /profile` endpoint with a token via the `Authorization` request header.

2. When the HTTP request reaches APIG, it will check if a Lambda Authorizer is configured for the called endpoint. If so, APIG will invoke the Lambda Authorizer.

3. The Lambda Authorizer will then:

- Extract the token from the `Authorization` request header.
- Fetch the JWKS (which contains the public key) from Auth0.
- Verify the token signature with the fetched public key.
- Verify the token has the correct issuer and audience claims.

4. If the token is verified, the Lambda Authorizer will return an IAM Policy document with `Effect` set to `Allow`.

5. APIG will now evaluate the IAM Policy and if the `Effect` is set to `Allow`, it will invoke the specified Lambda handler.

6. The Lambda handler will execute and when the `get:profile` scope is present, it will return the profile data back to the client.

Now for the easy part, writing the code!

## Implementing the Lambda Authorizer

We'll do this by:

- [[#1. Setting up the project]]
- [[#2. Configuring a Serverless manifest]]
- [[#3. Defining the Lambda Authorizer]]
- [[#4. Getting the token]]
- [[#5. Verifying the token]]
- [[#6. Creating the auth response]]
- [[#7. Releasing the Lambda Authorizer]]

### 1. Setting up the project

Create a new directory for the code:

```sh
mkdir lambda-authorizers
```

Move to this directory and initialize a new [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) project with:

```sh
npm init -y
```

This creates a `package.json` file. Now you can install the following required npm dependencies:

```sh
npm i jsonwebtoken jwks-rsa
```

The [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken) library will help use decode the bearer token (a JWT) and verify its signature, issuer and audience claims. The [jwks-rsa](https://github.com/auth0/node-jwks-rsa) library will help us fetch the JWKS from Auth0.

We'll use the Serverless Framework to configure and upload the Lambda to AWS, so install it as a dev dependency:

```sh
npm i -D serverless
```

### 2. Configuring a Serverless manifest

Create a Serverless manifest:

```yaml title="lambda-authorizers/serverless.yaml" showLineNumbers
service: lambda-authorizers

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs8.10
  stage: ${opt:stage, 'prod'}
  region: ${opt:region, 'eu-central-1'}
  memorySize: 128
  timeout: 3

package:
  exclude:
    - ./*
    - ./**/*.test.js
  include:
    - node_modules
    - src
```

Add the properties we got from the [[#Lambda Authorizer configuration]] as environment variables. For example:

```yaml title="lambda-authorizers/serverless.yaml" showLineNumbers{10-13}
service: lambda-authorizers

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs8.10
  stage: ${opt:stage, 'prod'}
  region: ${opt:region, 'eu-central-1'}
  memorySize: 128
  timeout: 3
  environment:
    JWKS_URI: "https://danillouz.eu.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
    TOKEN_ISSUER: "https://danillouz.eu.auth0.com/"
    AUDIENCE: "https://api.danillouz.dev/account"

package:
  exclude:
    - ./*
    - ./**/*.test.js
  include:
    - node_modules
    - src
```

And add the Lambda function definition:

```yaml yaml title="lambda-authorizers/serverless.yaml" showLineNumbers{23-26}
service: lambda-authorizers

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs8.10
  stage: ${opt:stage, 'prod'}
  region: ${opt:region, 'eu-central-1'}
  memorySize: 128
  timeout: 3
  environment:
    JWKS_URI: "https://danillouz.eu.auth0.com/.well-known/jwks.json"
    TOKEN_ISSUER: "https://danillouz.eu.auth0.com/"
    AUDIENCE: "https://api.danillouz.dev/account"

package:
  exclude:
    - ./*
    - ./**/*.test.js
  include:
    - node_modules
    - src

functions:
  auth0VerifyBearer:
    handler: src/auth0.verifyBearer
    description: Verifies the bearer token with the help of Auth0
```

### 3. Defining the Lambda Authorizer

In order to match the Lambda function definition in the Serverless manifest, create a file named `auth0.js` in `src`. And in that file export a method named `verifyBearer`:

```js title="lambda-authorizers/src/auth0.js" showLineNumbers
"use strict"

module.exports.verifyBearer = async () => {
  try {
    // Lambda Authorizer implementation goes here.
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Authorizer Error: ", err)
    throw new Error("Unauthorized")
  }
}
```

If something goes wrong in the Lambda, we'll log the error and throw a new `Unauthorized` error. This will make APIG return a `401 Unauthorized` response back to the caller[^5].

[^5]: The thrown error message _must_ match the string `"Unauthorized"` _exactly_ for this to work.

### 4. Getting the token

The Lambda will first have to get the bearer token from the `Authorization` request header. Create a helper function for that in `src/get-token.js`. And in that file export a function named `getToken`:

```js title="lambda-authorizers/src/get-token.js" showLineNumbers
"use strict"

module.exports = function getToken(event) {
  if (event.type !== "TOKEN") {
    throw new Error('Authorizer must be of type "TOKEN"')
  }

  const { authorizationToken: bearer } = event
  if (!bearer) {
    throw new Error('Authorization header with "Bearer TOKEN" must be provided')
  }

  const [, token] = bearer.match(/^Bearer (.*)$/) || []
  if (!token) {
    throw new Error("Invalid bearer token")
  }

  return token
}
```

Here we're only interested in `TOKEN` events because we're implementing a [[#What's a Lambda Authorizer?|token based authorizer]]. And we can access the value of the `Authorization` request header via the `event.authorizationToken` property.

Then `require` and call the helper in the Lambda with the APIG HTTP input [event](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html#api-gateway-simple-proxy-for-lambda-input-format) as an argument:

```js title="lambda-authorizers/src/auth0.js" showLineNumbers {3,7}
"use strict"

const getToken = require("./get-token")

module.exports.verifyBearer = async (event) => {
  try {
    const token = getToken(event)
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Authorizer Error: ", err)
    throw new Error("Unauthorized")
  }
}
```

### 5. Verifying the token

Now we have the token, we need to verify it by:

1. Decoding the bearer token (JWT).
2. Fetching the public key from Auth0 using the JWKS URI (used to verify the token signature).
3. Verifying the token signature, issuer and audience claims.

We'll use another helper function for this. Create one in `src/verify-token.js`, and export a function named `verifyToken`:

```js title="lambda-authorizers/src/verify-token.js" showLineNumbers
"use strict"

module.exports = async function verifyToken(
  token,
  decodeJwt,
  getSigningKey,
  verifyJwt,
  issuer,
  audience,
) {
  // Step 1.
  const decoded = decodeJwt(token, { complete: true })

  if (!decoded || !decoded.header || !decoded.header.kid) {
    throw new Error("Invalid JWT")
  }

  // Step 2.
  const { publicKey, rsaPublicKey } = await getSigningKey(decoded.header.kid)
  const signingKey = publicKey || rsaPublicKey

  // Step 3.
  return verifyJwt(token, signingKey, {
    issuer,
    audience,
  })
}
```

After we decode the token with the option `{ complete: true }`, we can access the JWT `header` data. And by using the [kid](https://community.auth0.com/t/what-is-the-origin-of-the-kid-claim-in-the-jwt/8431) JWT claim, we can find out which key was used to sign the token.

When we registered the API with Auth0 we chose the `RS256` signing algorithm. This algorithm generates an asymmetric signature. Which basically means that Auth0 uses a _private key_ to sign a JWT when it issues one. And we can use a _public key_ (fetched via the JWKS URI) to verify the authenticity of the token.

First require the helper in the Lambda and pass the `token` as the first argument when calling it:

```js title="lambda-authorizers/src/auth0.js" showLineNumbers {4,9}
"use strict"

const getToken = require("./get-token")
const verifyToken = require("./verify-token")

module.exports.verifyBearer = async (event) => {
  try {
    const token = getToken(event)
    const verifiedData = await verifyToken(token)
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Authorizer Error: ", err)
    throw new Error("Unauthorized")
  }
}
```

To decode the token in the helper (step 1), we'll use the `jsonwebtoken` library. It exposes a `decode` method. Pass this method as the second argument when calling the helper:

```js title="lambda-authorizers/src/auth0.js" showLineNumbers {3,11}
"use strict"

const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken")

const getToken = require("./get-token")
const verifyToken = require("./verify-token")

module.exports.verifyBearer = async (event) => {
  try {
    const token = getToken(event)
    const verifiedData = await verifyToken(token, jwt.decode)
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Authorizer Error: ", err)
    throw new Error("Unauthorized")
  }
}
```

To fetch the public key from Auth0 (step 2) we'll use the `jwks-rsa` library. It exposes a client with `getSigningKey` method to fetch the key. Pas a "promisified" version of this method as the third argument when calling the helper:

```js title="lambda-authorizers/src/auth0.js" showLineNumbers {3,5,10,11-17,22}
"use strict"

const util = require("util")
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken")
const jwksRSA = require("jwks-rsa")

const getToken = require("./get-token")
const verifyToken = require("./verify-token")

const { JWKS_URI } = process.env

const jwksClient = jwksRSA({
  cache: true,
  rateLimit: true,
  jwksUri: JWKS_URI,
})
const getSigningKey = util.promisify(jwksClient.getSigningKey)

module.exports.verifyBearer = async (event) => {
  try {
    const token = getToken(event)
    const verifiedData = await verifyToken(token, jwt.decode, getSigningKey)
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Authorizer Error: ", err)
    throw new Error("Unauthorized")
  }
}
```

Finally, to verify the token signature, issuer and audience claims (step 3) we'll use the `jsonwebtoken` library again. It exposes a `verify` method. Pass a "promisified" version of this method together with the `TOKEN_ISSUER` and `AUDIENCE` as the final arguments when calling the helper:

```js title="lambda-authorizers/src/auth0.js" showLineNumbers {10,18,27-29}
"use strict"

const util = require("util")
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken")
const jwksRSA = require("jwks-rsa")

const getToken = require("./get-token")
const verifyToken = require("./verify-token")

const { JWKS_URI, TOKEN_ISSUER, AUDIENCE } = process.env

const jwksClient = jwksRSA({
  cache: true,
  rateLimit: true,
  jwksUri: JWKS_URI,
})
const getSigningKey = util.promisify(jwksClient.getSigningKey)
const verifyJwt = util.promisify(jwt.verify)

module.exports.verifyBearer = async (event) => {
  try {
    const token = getToken(event)
    const verifiedData = await verifyToken(
      token,
      jwt.decode,
      getSigningKey,
      verifyJwt,
      TOKEN_ISSUER,
      AUDIENCE,
    )
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Authorizer Error: ", err)
    throw new Error("Unauthorized")
  }
}
```

When the helper verifies the token, it will return the JWT payload data (with all claims) as `verifiedData`. For example:

```json title="verifiedData"
{
  "iss": "https://danillouz.eu.auth0.com/",
  "sub": "FHgLVARPk8oXjsP5utP8wYAnZePPAkw1@clients",
  "aud": "https://api.danillouz.dev/account",
  "iat": 1560762850,
  "exp": 1560849250,
  "azp": "FHgLVARPk8oXjsP5utP8wYAnZePPAkw1",
  "gty": "client-credentials"
}
```

### 6. Creating the auth response

We'll use `verifiedData` to create the `authResponse`:

```js title="lambda-authorizers/src/auth0.js" showLineNumbers {23,31-44}
"use strict"

const util = require("util")
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken")
const jwksRSA = require("jwks-rsa")

const getToken = require("./get-token")
const verifyToken = require("./verify-token")

const { JWKS_URI, TOKEN_ISSUER, AUDIENCE } = process.env

const jwksClient = jwksRSA({
  cache: true,
  rateLimit: true,
  jwksUri: JWKS_URI,
})
const getSigningKey = util.promisify(jwksClient.getSigningKey)
const verifyJwt = util.promisify(jwt.verify)

module.exports.verifyBearer = async (event) => {
  try {
    const token = getToken(event)
    const verifiedData = await verifyToken(
      token,
      jwt.decode,
      getSigningKey,
      verifyJwt,
      TOKEN_ISSUER,
      AUDIENCE,
    )
    const authResponse = {
      principalId: verifiedData.sub,
      policyDocument: {
        Version: "2012-10-17",
        Statement: [
          {
            Action: "execute-api:Invoke",
            Effect: "Allow",
            Resource: event.methodArn,
          },
        ],
      },
    }
    return authResponse
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Authorizer Error: ", err)
    throw new Error("Unauthorized")
  }
}
```

#### Principal identifier

The `authResponse.principalId` property must represent a unique (user) identifier associated with the token sent by the client. Auth0 provides this via the `sub` claim and ours has the value:

```json title="verifiedData" {3}
{
  "iss": "https://danillouz.eu.auth0.com/",
  "sub": "FHgLVARPk8oXjsP5utP8wYAnZePPAkw1@clients", // Principal ID
  "aud": "https://api.danillouz.dev/account",
  "iat": 1560762850,
  "exp": 1560849250,
  "azp": "FHgLVARPk8oXjsP5utP8wYAnZePPAkw1",
  "gty": "client-credentials"
}
```

Note that if you use an Auth0 test token (like we'll do in a bit), the `sub` claim will be postfixed with `@clients`. This is because Auth0 automatically created a "Test Application" for us when we registered the Account API with them. And it's via this application that we obtain the test token, obtained via the [client credentials grant](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/client-credentials) (specified by the `gty` claim).

In this case the test application represents a "machine" and _not_ a user. But that's okay because the machine has a unique identifier the same way a user would have (by means of a client ID). This means that this implementation will also work when using "user centric" auth flows like the [implicit grant](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/concepts/implicit).

You can find the test application in the Auth0 dashboard by navigating to "Applications" and selecting "Account API (Test Application)".

![[_assets/Serverless auth/Auth0/Test application.png]]

#### Method ARN

The [ARN](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-arns-and-namespaces.html) of the Lambda handler associated with the called endpoint can be obtained from `event.methodArn`. APIG will use this ARN to invoke said Lambda handler. In our case this will be the Lambda handler that gets the profile data.

#### Granting a client scopes

Like mentioned when discussing [[#Scopes]], Auth0 can provide scopes as authorization information. In order for Auth0 to do this, we need to "grant" our client the `get:profile` scope. In our case, the client is the "Test Application" that has been created for us.

Navigate to the "APIs" tab in the "Test Application" details and click on the "right pointing chevron" (circled in red) to the right of "Account API".

![[_assets/Serverless auth/Auth0/Grant scope 1.png]]

Then check the `get:profile` scope, click "Update" and click "Continue".

![[_assets/Serverless auth/Auth0/Grant scope 2.png]]

Now the configured scope will be a claim on issued test tokens, and part of the `verifiedData`:

```json title="verifiedData" {8}
{
  "iss": "https://danillouz.eu.auth0.com/",
  "sub": "FHgLVARPk8oXjsP5utP8wYAnZePPAkw1@clients",
  "aud": "https://api.danillouz.dev/account",
  "iat": 1560762850,
  "exp": 1560849250,
  "azp": "FHgLVARPk8oXjsP5utP8wYAnZePPAkw1",
  "scope": "get:profile", // Scope is now a claim
  "gty": "client-credentials"
}
```

So we can propagate it to downstream Lambda handlers like this:

```js title="lambda-authorizers/src/auth0.js" showLineNumbers {43-45}
"use strict"

const util = require("util")
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken")
const jwksRSA = require("jwks-rsa")

const getToken = require("./get-token")
const verifyToken = require("./verify-token")

const { JWKS_URI, TOKEN_ISSUER, AUDIENCE } = process.env

const jwksClient = jwksRSA({
  cache: true,
  rateLimit: true,
  jwksUri: JWKS_URI,
})
const getSigningKey = util.promisify(jwksClient.getSigningKey)
const verifyJwt = util.promisify(jwt.verify)

module.exports.verifyBearer = async (event) => {
  try {
    const token = getToken(event)
    const verifiedData = await verifyToken(
      token,
      jwt.decode,
      getSigningKey,
      verifyJwt,
      TOKEN_ISSUER,
      AUDIENCE,
    )
    const authResponse = {
      principalId: verifiedData.sub,
      policyDocument: {
        Version: "2012-10-17",
        Statement: [
          {
            Action: "execute-api:Invoke",
            Effect: "Allow",
            Resource: event.methodArn,
          },
        ],
      },
      context: {
        scope: verifiedData.scope, // Propagate scope downstream
      },
    }
    return authResponse
  } catch (err) {
    console.log("Authorizer Error: ", err)
    throw new Error("Unauthorized")
  }
}
```

### 7. Releasing the Lambda Authorizer

Finally, add a release command to the `package.json`:

```json title="lambda-authorizers/package.json" showLineNumbers {4}
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "release": "serverless deploy --stage prod"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "jsonwebtoken": "^8.5.1",
    "jwks-rsa": "^1.5.1"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "serverless": "^1.45.1"
  }
}
```

And to upload the Lambda to AWS, [sign up](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup) and make sure you have your [credentials configured](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html). Then release the Lambda by running `npm run release`:

```sh title="npm run release output" {25}

Service Information

service: lambda-authorizers
stage: prod
region: eu-central-1
stack: lambda-authorizers-prod
resources: 5
api keys:
  None
endpoints:
  None
functions:
  auth0VerifyBearer: lambda-authorizers-prod-auth0VerifyBearer
layers:
  None
```

#### Finding the ARN

Now go to the AWS Console and visit the "Lambda" service. Find `lambda-authorizers-prod-auth0VerifyBearer` under "Functions" and take note of the ARN in the top right corner.

![[_assets/Serverless auth/AWS/Lambda authorizer ARN.png]]

We'll need this to configure the Account API in the next part.

## Implementing the Account API

We'll do this by:

- [[#1. Setting up the API project]]
- [[#2. Configuring the Serverless manifest]]
- [[#3. Defining the Lambda handler]]
- [[#4. Releasing the API]]
- [[#5. Configuring the Lambda Authorizer]]
- [[#6. Adding authorization logic]]
- [[#7. Releasing the API with auth enabled]]
- [[#8. Getting a test token]]

### 1. Setting up the API project

Similar to the Lambda Authorizer, create a new directory for the code:

```sh
mkdir account-api
```

Move to this directory and initialize a new npm project with:

```sh
npm init -y
```

This creates a `package.json` file. Again, we'll use the Serverless Framework to configure and upload the Lambda to AWS, so install it as a dev dependency:

```sh
npm i -D serverless
```

### 2. Configuring the Serverless manifest

Create a Serverless manifest, and add the Lambda function definition for the `GET /profile` endpoint handler:

```yaml title="account-api/serverless.yaml" showLineNumbers
service: account-api

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs8.10
  stage: ${opt:stage, 'prod'}
  region: ${opt:region, 'eu-central-1'}
  memorySize: 128
  timeout: 3

package:
  exclude:
    - ./*
    - ./**/*.test.js
  include:
    - node_modules
    - src

functions:
  getProfile:
    handler: src/handler.getProfile
    description: Gets the user profile data
    events:
      - http:
          path: /profile
          method: get
```

### 3. Defining the Lambda handler

In order to match the Lambda function definition in the Serverless manifest, create a file named `handler.js` in `src`. And in that file export a method named `getProfile`:

```js title="account-api/src/handler.js" showLineNumbers
"use strict"

module.exports.getProfile = async () => {
  try {
    // Lambda handler implementation goes here.
  } catch (err) {
    const statusCode = err.code || 500
    return {
      statusCode,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        message: err.message,
        info: err.info,
      }),
    }
  }
}
```

If something goes wrong in the Lambda, we'll return an error response as [HTTP output](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html#api-gateway-simple-proxy-for-lambda-output-format) back to the caller.

Otherwise we'll return the profile data:

```js title="account-api/src/handler.js" showLineNumbers {5-11}
"use strict"

module.exports.getProfile = async () => {
  try {
    const profileData = {
      name: "Daniël",
    }
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify(profileData),
    }
  } catch (err) {
    const statusCode = err.code || 500
    return {
      statusCode,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        message: err.message,
        info: err.info,
      }),
    }
  }
}
```

Before we enable auth, let's first release the API to see if we can call the endpoint.

### 4. Releasing the API

Add a release command to the `package.json`:

```js title="account-api/package.json" showLineNumbers {4}
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "release": "serverless deploy --stage prod"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "serverless": "^1.45.1"
  }
}
```

Then release the Lambda by running `npm run release`:

```sh title="npm run release output" {23}
Serverless: Packaging service...
Serverless: Excluding development dependencies...
Serverless: Creating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack create progress...
Serverless: Stack create finished...
Serverless: Uploading CloudFormation file to S3...
Serverless: Uploading artifacts...
Serverless: Uploading service account-api.zip file to S3...
Serverless: Validating template...
Serverless: Updating Stack...
Serverless: Checking Stack update progress...
Serverless: Stack update finished...
Service Information

service: account-api
stage: prod
region: eu-central-1
stack: account-api-prod
resources: 10
api keys:
  None
endpoints:
  GET - https://9jwh.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod/profile
functions:
  getProfile: account-api-prod-getProfile
layers:
  None
```

Now try to call the endpoint that has been created for you. For example:

```sh
curl https://9jwh.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod/profile
```

It should return:

```sh title="HTTP response"
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Daniël"
}
```

### 5. Configuring the Lambda Authorizer

Now we know the endpoint is working, we'll protect it by adding a custom `authorizer` property in the `serverless.yaml` manifest:

```yaml title="account-api/serverless.yaml" showLineNumbers {3-9,36}
service: account-api

custom:
  authorizer:
    arn: LAMBDA_AUTHORIZER_ARN
    resultTtlInSeconds: 0
    identitySource: method.request.header.Authorization
    identityValidationExpression: '^Bearer [-0-9a-zA-z\.]*$'
    type: token

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs8.10
  stage: ${opt:stage, 'prod'}
  region: ${opt:region, 'eu-central-1'}
  memorySize: 128
  timeout: 3
  profile: danillouz

package:
  exclude:
    - ./*
    - ./**/*.test.js
  include:
    - node_modules
    - src

functions:
  getProfile:
    handler: src/handler.getProfile
    description: Gets the user profile
    events:
      - http:
          path: /profile
          method: get
          authorizer: ${self:custom.authorizer}
```

Let's go over the `authorizer` properties:

- `arn`: must be the value of the Lambda Authorizer ARN we [[#Finding the ARN|released]] before.
- `resultTtlInSeconds`: used to cache the IAM Policy document returned from the Lambda Authorizer[^6].
- `identitySource`: where APIG should "look" for the bearer token.
- `identityValidationExpression`: the expression used to extract the token from the `identitySource`.

[^6]: Caching is _disabled_ when set to `0`. When caching is enabled and a policy document has been cached, the Lambda Authorizer will _not_ be executed. According to the AWS [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/configure-api-gateway-lambda-authorization-with-console.html) the default value is `300` seconds and the max value is `3600` seconds.

### 6. Adding authorization logic

Now the Lambda Authorizer is configured and we also propagate the `get:profile` scope from the Lambda Authorizer, we can check if a caller has been granted the required scope. If not, we'll return a `403 Forbidden` response back to the caller:

```js title="account-api/src/handler.js" showLineNumbers {3,7-15}
"use strict"

const REQUIRED_SCOPE = "get:profile"

module.exports.getProfile = async (event) => {
  try {
    const { authorizer = {} } = event.requestContext
    const { scope = "" } = authorizer
    const hasScope = scope.split(" ").includes(REQUIRED_SCOPE)
    if (!hasScope) {
      const err = new Error("Forbidden")
      err.code = 403
      err.info = 'scope "get:profile" is required'
      throw err
    }

    const profileData = {
      name: "Daniël",
    }
    return {
      statusCode: 200,
      body: JSON.stringify(profileData),
    }
  } catch (err) {
    const statusCode = err.code || 500
    return {
      statusCode,
      body: JSON.stringify({
        message: err.message,
        info: err.info,
      }),
    }
  }
}
```

Note that the `authorizer.scope` is a string and that it may contain more than one scope value. When multiple scopes are configured, they will be space separated like this:

```js title="authorizer.scope"
"get:profile update:profile"
```

### 7. Releasing the API with auth enabled

Do another release by running `npm run release`. And after Serverless finishes, go to the AWS Console and visit the "API Gateway" service. Navigate to "prod-account-api" and click on the "GET" resource under "/profile". You should now see that the "Method Request" tile has a property "Auth" set to `auth0VerifyBearer`.

![[_assets/Serverless auth/AWS/Lambda authorizer ARN.png]]

This means our `GET /profile` endpoint is properly configured with a Lambda Authorizer. And we now require a bearer token to get the profile data. Let's verify this by making the same `curl` request like before (without a token):

```sh
curl https://9jwh.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod/profile
```

It should return:

```sh title="HTTP response"
401 Unauthorized
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Unauthorized"
}
```

### 8. Getting a test token

We can get a test token from the Auth0 dashboard by navigating to the "Test" tab in the API details screen.

![[_assets/Serverless auth/Auth0/Test.png]]

If you scroll to the bottom, you'll see a `curl` command displayed with a ready to use test token:

```sh
curl --request GET \
  --url http://path_to_your_api/ \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer eyJ...lKw'
```

Pretty cool right! Use this, but set the URL to your profile endpoint. For example:

```sh
curl --request GET \
  --url https://9jwh.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod/profile \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer eyJ...lKw'
```

This should return the profile data again:

```sh title="HTTP response"
200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Daniël"
}
```

Also, sending a token _without_ the required scope should return a `403`:

```sh title="HTTP response"
403 Forbidden
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "message": "Error: Forbidden",
  "info": "scope \"get:profile\" is required"
}
```

Awesome! We successfully secured our API with a token based authentication strategy. So only authenticated _and_ authorized clients can access it now!

## CORS headers

On a final note, when your API needs to return [CORS headers](https://serverless.com/blog/cors-api-gateway-survival-guide), make sure to add a [custom APIG Response](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/supported-gateway-response-types.html) as well:

```yaml title="account-api/serverless.yaml" showLineNumbers {37-56}
service: account-api

custom:
  authorizer:
    arn: LAMBDA_AUTHORIZER_ARN
    resultTtlInSeconds: 0
    identitySource: method.request.header.Authorization
    identityValidationExpression: '^Bearer [-0-9a-zA-z\.]*$'
    type: token

provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: nodejs8.10
  stage: ${opt:stage, 'prod'}
  region: ${opt:region, 'eu-central-1'}
  memorySize: 128
  timeout: 3

package:
  exclude:
    - ./*
    - ./**/*.test.js
  include:
    - node_modules
    - src

functions:
  getProfile:
    handler: src/handler.getProfile
    description: Gets the user profile
    events:
      - http:
          path: /profile
          method: get
          authorizer: ${self:custom.authorizer}

resources:
  Resources:
    GatewayResponseDefault4XX:
      Type: "AWS::ApiGateway::GatewayResponse"
      Properties:
        ResponseParameters:
          gatewayresponse.header.Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "'*'"
          gatewayresponse.header.Access-Control-Allow-Headers: "'*'"
        ResponseType: DEFAULT_4XX
        RestApiId:
          Ref: "ApiGatewayRestApi"
    GatewayResponseDefault5XX:
      Type: "AWS::ApiGateway::GatewayResponse"
      Properties:
        ResponseParameters:
          gatewayresponse.header.Access-Control-Allow-Origin: "'*'"
          gatewayresponse.header.Access-Control-Allow-Headers: "'*'"
        ResponseType: DEFAULT_5XX
        RestApiId:
          Ref: "ApiGatewayRestApi"
```

When the Lambda Authorizer throws an error or returns a "Deny" policy, APIG will _not_ execute any Lambda handlers. This means that the CORS settings you added to the Lambda handler wont be applied. That's why we must define additional APIG response resources, to make sure we always return the proper CORS headers.
